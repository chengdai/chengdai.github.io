I am a Master of Engineering student in Computer Science and Molecular Biology at MIT. As a joint member of [Eric Alm's lab](http://almlab.mit.edu/) and the [Senseable City Lab](http://senseable.mit.edu), I study the [microbiome of urban sewage](http://underworlds.mit.edu) for public health surveillance and epidemiology. I also collaborate with the [National Geographic's Genographic Project](https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com/about/) on using genomic data to understand ancestry and demographic patterns in the United States. My interests lie in applying computational and quantitative methods to genomics to better understand populations and to drive public health decisions. More generally, I am passionate about bringing science and business together to make research accessible to the public so that we can together solve the biggest issues in health and medicine.

## Personal Causes

[Camp Kesem](http://campkesem.org/mit) - Providing children of cancer patients the opportunity to connect with other children facing similar challenges through a worry-free, week-long summer camp. 

[Amphibious Achievement](http://amphibious.mit.edu/) - Helping low-resourced high school students achieve their highest potential through academic and athletic mentorship. 

## Random Facts ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

- I'm a Michigander and a loyal [Michigan Wolverines](http://mgoblue.com/) fan. (Yes, I use my hands to explain Michigan.) 
- I've ran three marathons, including the Boston Marathon. (If you need a reason to run a marathon, look [here](http://www.wbur.org/news/2014/04/08/team-hoyt-boston-marathon) and [here](https://www.boston.com/sports/boston-marathon/2017/04/15/running-pioneers-kathrine-switzer-bobbi-gibb-took-their-own-paths-to-change).)
- [Detroit-style Pizza](https://www.eater.com/2016/1/19/10787414/detroit-style-pizza) is the best type of pizza out there. (Sorry, Chicago and New York.)
