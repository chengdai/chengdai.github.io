I am a software engineer and data scientist at the Institute for Systems Biology (formerly Arivale), where I leverage multi-omic data to better understand human health and disease. Previously, I was a Master of Engineering student in Computer Science and Molecular Biology at MIT. There, I collaborated with the [National Geographic's Genographic Project](https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com/about/) to understand ancestry and demographic patterns in the United States using genomic data.  I also studied antibiotic resistance in the [microbiome of humans and urban environments](http://underworlds.mit.edu) for public health surveillance and epidemiology, working as part of [Eric Alm's lab](http://almlab.mit.edu/) and the [Senseable City Lab](http://senseable.mit.edu).  My interests lie in applying computational and quantitative methods to better understand populations and to drive health decisions. More generally, I am passionate about making science and research more accessible to the public so that we can together solve the biggest issues in health and medicine.
